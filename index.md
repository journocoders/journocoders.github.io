We help journalists and other people working in the media develop technical skills for use in their reporting.

That might be data analysis as part of an investigation, scraping data from government websites, building data visualisations to better tell a story, or something else entirely.

We run a free monthly meetup in London where we try to learn these skills together. All sessions are appropriate for complete beginners and above.

We tweet out each meetup from [@journocoders](https://twitter.com/journocoders). There is also a [Slack channel](https://journocoders.slack.com/) you can join -- DM us your email on Twitter to get an invite.

Not in London? We are also in [Madrid](/mad)!
