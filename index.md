We help journalists and other people working in the media develop technical skills for use in their reporting.

That might be data analysis as part of an investigation, scraping data from government websites, building data visualisations to better tell a story, or something else entirely.

We run a free monthly meetup in London where we try to learn these skills together. All sessions are appropriate for complete beginners and above.

We also tweet out each meetup from [@journocoders](https://twitter.com/journocoders).

As well as the meetup we are building [an online Journocoders community on Slack](https://journocoders.slack.com/). It's a space to discuss using code in our reporting, chat about jobs, and help each other out when we get stuck. [Sign up here.](https://bit.ly/journocoders-community-signup)

Organised by [@leilahaddou](https://twitter.com/leilahaddou) and [@maxharlow](https://twitter.com/maxharlow).
