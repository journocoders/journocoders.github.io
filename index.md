We are a community group of journalists and others who work in the media, or are planning to in the future.

Together, we aim to learn and share âœ¨ technical skills for use in our reporting in a supportive environment.

That might be ðŸ”Ž data analysis as part of an investigation, ðŸ’» scraping data from government websites, ðŸ“‰ building data visualisations to better tell a story, or something else entirely.

We meet monthly in London to learn and network. All sessions are appropriate for complete beginners and above.
